# Cyclistic-Bike-Share

This case study is the final module of the Google Data Analytics certificate. Throughout this case study, I will be analysing historical data for a hypothetical company called Cyclistic, a Chicago based bike sharing company. The case study scenario is as follows:

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
